# Technical Debt

## What is considered Technical Debt?

Technical debt arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. All technical debt is non-customer facing changes; if it becomes customer facing then it is not longer considered technical debt and will go through a Business Owner to go through the regular Feature Request process.

## Tracking Technical Debt

All technical debt will be tracked in target process. There is an Epic in Target Process that includes several features to place technical debt under as user stories. Anyone can add user stories under the appropriate feature in Target Process but it is the responsibility of the person that adds the story to:

* Provide the necessary information about work needed
* Provide a story point estimate
* Communicate the addition to a Lead Developer for prioritization in the overall Technical Debt Backlog

Technical Debt stories do not require an actual user story but must include criteria that provide detail on what is being touched, what will be impacted, and what kind of testing will be needed.

## Technical Debt Backlog

The Technical Debt Backlog will be maintained by Lead Developers. They will work to keep the backlog in prioritized order and communicate reason for the prioritized order to the team for transparency and understanding. The Leads will help to ensure technical debt stories are all broken down into small user stories; no more than 5 story points if possible.

## Technical Debt and Sprints

The Product Owner and Development Teams will work to prioritize 3-5 story points worth of technical debt user stories into each sprint; unless extra work is needed or permitted. There may be situations that do not permit such prioritization such as:

* A sprint filled with work that has deadlines that would otherwise be missed
* A sprint where the team is catching up from a lot of unforeseen carry over

The Defect Team may also choose to take on some technical debt stories if at any point they need more work. The team will reach out to the Development Leads if that need arises to ensure the pull the top priority from the backlog.

## Other Thoughts / Questions

Can we include system or software updates that we know will need to be done so we get ahead of that work as well? Is that under the same epic?
