# Scrum Process

## Ideation
Where all great ideas start out. They come here for review and to collect further details until a time when the steering committee decides to move forward with it.

## Scoping
When ideas have been approved to move forward by the steering committee, they move into scoping. Scoping is a time to get rough estimates of work to be done in the form of a T-Shirt sizing, compile cost, revenue and ROI information, and complete out feature requirements:

* Problem
* Vision
* Goal
* MVP Requirements
* Launch Plan

Scoping is also a time for team leads to ask initial questions to the stakeholders and get feedback before refinement.

**When does this meeting occur?** Whenever scoping work needs to be done after items move over from ideation.

User stories should be defined or made clear during scoping. Ideally, stakeholders are responsible for creating user stories, which define value in the perspective of a customer. Until user stories are defined, there are no artifacts available to be moved into refinement.

## Refinement
The refinement meeting is a time-boxed meeting for the scrum team to get in the same room and accomplish two very important tasks:

1. Groom the backlog so that two to three sprints' worth of user stories are ready for development.
2. Refine backlog user stories to be ready for development.

**When does this meeting occur?** The second Monday of a sprint.

During refinement, with the help of the scrum master and product owner, the scrum team should be able to define priority and associate user stories to the correct sprint based on business needs.

Ideally, user stories should go through two refinement meetings before development commences on them. The first refinement meeting would be the coarse refinement which you narrow down acceptance criteria and clarify business objectives. The second refinement would be for defining discrete tasks for work to be done based on the acceptance criteria.

Be careful not to **overplan**. User stories should have just enough planning to get started on development. It is okay to have some unanswered questions during the sprint **collaboration between a developer and stakeholder is encouraged**.
