# Sprint Development
Sprints last for 2 weeks. There are daily rituals that occur during this time, namely the daily stand-up and completing assigned user stories.

During development, a developer should be keeping careful watch of their assigned stories that are currently in testing. They are accountable for those items and should follow-up with the QA tester so it does not become an impediment.

## If you complete items sooner than expected, what should you work on?
Sometimes it happens, we plan out a sprint and because you are a rockstar, you get done early! But now what? Should I twiddle my thumbs until the sprint is over? Luckily, we have a list just for this!

1. **See if there are any outstanding code reviews you can help out on.**
2. **See if there are other user stories that you can help out on.** Stories that have not been started yet are the highest priority, followed by items that are partially done. *Be careful!* Do not interrupt somebody's workflow as they may be unwelcoming to an interruption; they are trying to complete their work for the sprint as well.
3. **Technical Debt Backlog items.**
4. **Look at error logs** to see if anything is getting past our radar.
5. **Research and reading** on newest happenings and trends in the industry. Try something new!
6. **Pull from next sprint.** Contact the scrum master and pull things off next sprint.
