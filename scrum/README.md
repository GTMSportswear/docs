## Agile Scrum - Overview
**Scrum** is one of several techniques for managing product development organizations, lumped under the broad category of agile software development. 

**Agile** approaches are designed to support iterative, flexible, and sustainable methods for running a product engineering organization.

## Scrum Roles
Scrum has no hierarchy, but each of the three roles has equal and defined responsibilities.

### Stakeholders
A product owner controls and steers a product in a direction that benefits the company and customers. The product owner is involved in steering committee meetings and responsible for pushing ideas for development.

A business owner has a shared responsibility to the team and to the customer. The business owner is the voice of the customer, and stands in as the representative of the customer's needs, wants, and expectations.

### Scrum Master
A scrum master is the glue that ties a scrum team together. Scrum masters are responsible for keeping people clear on their roles, managing the rituals and artifacts of scrum, and coaching people within the team and across the organization to help overcome blockers and maintain a sustainable productive pace.

Their responsibilities include the daily stand-up, the [sprint planning](#Planning) meeting, the [sprint review](#Review) meeting with stakeholders, and the [sprint retrospective](#Retrospective) meeting.

### Developer
Most scrum teams consist of a set of four to eight members. Their specializations should be planned to support the type of work the team is going to be responsible for, so they can estimate it well and produce results that meet the team's definition of done.

A team member is responsible for the quality of the product being developed, and for the preservation of the scrum process for the entire team. These are two aspects that every team member has the authority to affect by the way they perform their duties.

The team is expected to *push back against any attempts to sacrifice quality for the sake of speed*, given the practical constraints of the project. Additionally, the team should be tracking the overall quality of the code-base, and proposing stories that would refactor the existing code to enhance maintainability, or to support emerging technical standards. Keeping the code clean, self-documenting, and internally consistent helps everyone on the team work together more effectively.
